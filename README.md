# **Comprehensive Analysis of Electric Vehicle Registrations in Washington State - Insights from 2024 Data**
**Goal of the Project**
The goal of this project is to analyze the dataset of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) registered in Washington State as of December 12, 2024. By exploring this dataset, my aim is to derive meaningful insights, identify trends in EV adoption, and understand regional variations in EV distribution. This analysis will also highlight the potential for future EV growth and challenges.

* Derive insights through descriptive statistics.

**Conclusion and Future Directions:**

* Summarize findings, highlight limitations, and propose future research directions.


# **Key insights from this data analysis include:**

* The rising popularity of BEVs over PHEVs. There are 136,013 BEVs, indicating they form the majority of the electric vehicles in the dataset. There are 44,607 PHEVs, showing they are less common than BEVs.

* King is the top County which has maximum number of EV registrations.

* Maximum number of EV registrations happened in the year 2023, followed by the years 2024 and 2022.
